## Project Overview

- This is an *application-based* group project, a part of the DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms) application.
- The project aims to **simulate the admission process** for colleges. Students can apply for a degree program at a college using this system. Allocer is a completely merit-based allotment system. Students are admitted taking into consideration their Common Entrance Test (SRMJEE) marks and course preferences.
- The code is divided into different classes: menu, database, allotment_mechanism. Each file contains a class which has the related data members and functions defined in it. The functionality is divided mainly into 2 parts: For **Admin** and **Student**. Validations are added for all inputs to ensure an error-free experience.

### Features
- Forgot Password: A new temporary password will be emailed to the user.
- Password encryption by using a stronger algorithm.
- Validation of scores entered by the applicant by extracting the score from the uploaded scorecard in PDF form.
- Feature for students that allow them to download their allotment result as a PDF file and Admin feature to download the full allotment result list in the form of PDF.
- Course seat prediction, based on the score by using ML algorithms.
- Show statistics such as acceptance rate per course, gender-wise allocation chart, etc.
- Executing multiple allotment rounds - students will have the option to accept and freeze the allotted seat or try again for improvement in the next round.
